# is-awesome.cool

This project is quite useless. But it's still kinda cool!

All this website does is tell someone how awesome they are.

In order to make this single-page and not use hashbangs I used a cool little hack from
a [discussion about single page apps on GH pages](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/408). On that discussion
[@arzynik](https://github.com/arzynik) had a really cool suggestion which I used. I based my repository on [his example repo](https://github.com/arzynik/gh-pages-spa).
